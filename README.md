# Fruit-66-Demo

A chaotic, silly driving and cooking game made for GGDA's Best-In-Georgia Competition 2023.

This game is about you: the proud owner of a new smoothie-slinging food truck.  Unfortunately, staffing is a little tight these days, so you have to do everything yourself -- blending smoothies and delivering the drinks to your en-route customers, all while safely navigating the historic Route 66.

Your objective is to make the most money by delivering orders quickly and accurately, but watch out for other drivers on the road!
